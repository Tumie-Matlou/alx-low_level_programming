# Hello, World Directory

- This directory illustrates concepts and programs with regards to C language. <br>
- Some of these projects were achieved via shell scripts and shell script automations. <br>
- I used the GCC Compiler along Vi text editor to code in C language. <br>

# Tasks:

0. Preprocessor -  a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
1. Compiler - a script that compiles a C file but does not link
2. Assembler - a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
