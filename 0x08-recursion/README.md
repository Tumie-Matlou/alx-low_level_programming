# Recursion Directory

- This directory illustrates the concept of recursion in programming 
- How we can create a program that calls itself to avoid coding long, tedious code for repetitive tasks.
- Base case: The exit function for your program, if weak, your proram may enter an infinite loop
- Recurisive case: The function that solves the problem
